Tips

* Page List Menu in the header.php.(CSS Ready)
  By default,there is a Search From but not a Page List Menu.And there is not a Search From in the right sidebar.
  If you want to display the Page Menu List to replace the Search from.You may do it like this:
  First,add the 《!----》 tag to the Search Form code in the header to disable it,also,you can delete the code of search from forever.
  Then,delete the 《!----》 tag outside the Code of Page Menu List.Now there will show a Page List in the header.
  hmm,but now there have no search from all page.haha,don't worry,look at the sidebarr.php.
  delete the 《!----》 tag outside the Search From code.then there will display a Search From in the right sidebar.

* MyBlogLog Widget.
  I'v add some code in the css/misc.css file to modify the display of MyBlogLog,By default,there will not display the text "Join xxx".
  If you want to display it ,you can delete the code.
  And,now the widget is my blog(dupola.com),you can modify the Blog ID in MyBlogLog,and change the text to your own.
